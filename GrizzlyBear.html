				<hr>
				<p>Grizzly "Grizz" Bear is one of the main protagonists of We Bare Bears.
					Being a grizzly bear, he is familiar with the forest area the Bears live in. He is the leader of the three and is seen as such. He tries his best to do what's right for both the benefit of him and his family, but he can sometimes get carried away. Growing up without his guardians, much like his brothers, he grew up trying to be a model big brother.

						<h3><b>Panda Bear</b></h3>
						<p>		Grizzly and Panda are brothers. Grizzly is a leader figure to both Panda and Ice Bear. In "Our Stuff", Grizzly helps Panda find his backpack, which contained his phone, and can also bear stack as a way of traveling faster. The two have been shown to be very close to each other, especially in episodes such as "Jean Jacket", "Nom Nom", "Brother Up", "Occupy Bears", "The Road", and "Pet Shop", to name a few. In "Cupcake Job", while trying to protect themselves from being attacked by an angry mob of customers, the two admit what they had done to the laptop when they hatched the idea of making a giant cupcake. They end up scooping up all the cupcake batter that covered the room and used it to create a giant, and disgusting, cupcake. In "Hibernation", when Grizzly's brothers checked up on him, they woke him up because of a dream he was having. They then said they would head back to the cave to let him rest. Grizzly didn't want them to leave which led to Panda offering if he'd join them outside, to which Grizzly accepts. The three end up sitting out under the stars together.</p>

						<h3><b>Ice Bear</b></h3>
						<p>Grizzly and Ice Bear are brothers. Ice Bear is also shown to be close to Grizzly in episodes such as "Jean Jacket", where Grizzly sacrificed himself and Ice Bear cried (on the inside), or in "Viral Video" where he hugged Grizzly upon his return... Then slammed him onto the ground for ditching him and Panda. Ice Bear was also seen close, literally, to him in "Occupy Bears" and "Hibernation", and also in the cub episodes. In "Emergency", Grizzly knew all Ice Bear needed was alone time after finding him at the skating rink. Grizzly acts much like a leader figure to both Panda and Ice Bear, in which he is the older brother. He seems to hold a degree of respect for Ice Bear, and especially loves his food, to the point where he attempted to make a profit off it in the episode "Food Truck". Although there are times when Ice Bear can disagree with Grizzly, Ice Bear still cares about him and still helps him in times of need. Ice Bear is shown to be very protective of Grizzly in "Nom Nom".</p>

					<p>		Not much is known about <b>Grizzly's past</b>, though what is known is he was parentless from a very young age. It is unknown what happened to his parent(s) or who they were.

					He's first seen without them in a flashback during the beginning and very end of "Burrito". He's a very young cub at this point and is shown to be stuck in a large tree during a rain storm. He's also crying loudly in fear. The tree is surrounded by police cars and firetrucks and some bystanders who presumably called 911; authorities rushing to get the cub down safely.

					The firemen quickly prep before sending one of them up to retrieve the bear. Once he reaches the crying Grizzly, he reaches out his hand for him to grab onto. It takes a while to calm him down, but when he does, he grabs a tight hold onto the fireman's wrist before he heads down with the cub.

					After the situation dies down and all is calm, the firemen head off to take the cub to safety, Grizzly still tightly gripping onto the cuff of the man who saved him.</p>
